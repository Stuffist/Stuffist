\cvsection[page1sidebar]{About me}
	Experienced C++ developer with a strong background in backend side process, cache management and cloud related problematics. Since a couple of years I also work with big data and machine learning techniques to propose disruptive and innovative features.

	\medskip
	Being a dev for 10+ years, I learnt to build both reliable and efficient solutions - including operational concerns at the very first steps of the design.

	\medskip
	I am now looking for new technical and functional challenges - used to work in tense and highly competitive environments, I would like to work for a more user-oriented project. I love finding the best way to design pieces of software answering problem-solving purposes, long-term sustainability and maximum usability.

%% If the NEXT page doesn't start with a \cvsection but you'd
%% still like to add a sidebar, then use this command on THIS
%% page to add it. The optional argument lets you pull up the
%% sidebar a bit so that it looks aligned with the top of the
%% main column.

		Availability Process Engine is in charge of answering availability requests and providing seats and classes available for each flight (${\sim}$600k trx/sec at peak time).

		\medskip
		Performances and reliability are equally important under such constraints.

		\medskip
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Backend development and maintenance on \textbf{Availability Process Engine} - Key project: integration of external providers/aggregators content (\textbf{Pyton, Navitaire}\ldots).
			\item Porting \textbf{Availability Process Engine} from in-house servers to \textbf{cloud native technologies} (Google Cloud), including managing and \textbf{operating a 10To cache}.
			\item Development and data analysis for \textbf{Data Driven Polling} and \textbf{Data Driven Segmentation}: 2 machine learning based optimizations of APE processes/cache management.
			\item Head of \textbf{Inventory Analytics and Machine learning} community - promoting ML techniques among dev community and helping people from prototyping to industrialization.
		\end{itemize}

		In the middle of the booking process for the traveller, Ticketing is the part of system in charge of storing pricing results and editing the pre-contract agreement before final issuance of the ticket and payment. It is thus a key part for all parties (travellers, airlines, GDS and travel agencies) where the constraints on the data integrity and exactitude replace the high traffic pressure.

		\medskip
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Backend development and maintenance on \textbf{Ticketing, Pricing and Issuance parts} - Key project: integration of \textbf{Southwest Airlines} into Amadeus' Altéa suite.
			\item Backend development and maintenance on \textbf{Ticketing and Pricing parts} - Key project: enhancement of Quotations to handle \textbf{B2W Varejo} features.
			\item Member of the \textbf{Amadeus Data Governance} community - helping people designing \textbf{EDIFACT, XML or JSON} interfaces to ensure both coherence and robustness across all Amadeus services.

		The Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission conducts fundamental and applied research into many energy-related areas. One of its objectives is to lead experiments on nuclear fusion thanks to the Tore Supra tokamak reactor.
		
		\medskip
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Matlab} UI development to replay \textbf{Tore Supra shocks} (runs) - for security reasons real runs are not permitted when VIPs are visiting the reactor.
			\item Retrieving previously stored data from database and \textbf{extrapolate} missing points to \textbf{simulate and display} real-time measures.
		\end{itemize}
