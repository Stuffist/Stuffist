\cvsection[page1sidebar]{About me}
	Experienced C++ developer with a strong background in backend side process, cache management and cloud related problematics. Since a couple of years I also work with big data and machine learning techniques to propose disruptive and innovative features.

	\medskip
	Being a dev for 10+ years, I learnt to build both reliable and efficient solutions - including operational concerns at the very first steps of the design.

	\medskip
	I am always looking for technical and functional challenges to solve and I am used to work in tense and highly competitive environments. I love finding the best way to design pieces of software answering both problem-solving purposes and long-term sustainability.

%% If the NEXT page doesn't start with a \cvsection but you'd
%% still like to add a sidebar, then use this command on THIS
%% page to add it. The optional argument lets you pull up the
%% sidebar a bit so that it looks aligned with the top of the
%% main column.
